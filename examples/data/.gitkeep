# This directory is for KOSMOS FITS data
# 
# Expected structure:
# data/
# ├── biases/       - Bias frames (*.fits)
# ├── flats/        - Flat field frames (*.fits)
# ├── arcs/         - Arc lamp calibration frames (*.fits)
# └── science/      - Science target frames (*.fits)
#
# FITS files are ignored by .gitignore to avoid committing large binary data.
# Users should populate this directory with their own KOSMOS observations.
